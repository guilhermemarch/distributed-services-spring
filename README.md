# Microservices with Java Spring Boot and OpenFeign
This project involved the development of two microservices designed to work together, providing an integrated solution. MicroserviceB communicates with JsonPlaceholder API, managing interactions with its endpoints. Meanwhile, MicroserviceA serves as the client-facing 
service, delegating HTTP requests (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to MicroserviceB, which processes and executes them.

## Configuration

### Clone repository
This command will clone the repository to the directory where it is executed.
```
git clone https://github.com/DallaProRacing/Desafio2_Lord-of-Springs.git
```

### Database creation
The document will be created when you perform the HTTP POST request to syncData. You will need to refresh the localhost page for the document to appear.

Be aware that the port used for MongoDB is 27017. If you are using a different port, you can update it in the application.properties file of MicroserviceB and in the application-test.properties file located in the test directory of MicroserviceB.
